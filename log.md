## Day 1: July 5, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for navbar on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Started adding styles for header.

**Day Summary:** I was trying to figure out how to style the navbar. The links were still stacked up on each other so I was playing around with the Bootstrap classes. I was trying to use the documentation examples to troubleshoot the issues. Eventually I managed to get the link elements to be inline with each other by rearranging the Bootstrap classes. I did start adding styles for the header. Tomorrow I will concentrate on getting the header to work particularly getting the text in the middle of the background image if possible.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for the header. Try to figure out how to center text in the middle of background image.
- Use https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-3810/ to add more styles for story section.

## Day 2: July 6, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Added Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for header, story and celebration sections on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation page.

**Day Summary:** I finished the header. Although I used some of my original code from the first round of 100 Days of Code, I played around with the styles for the background image. A lot of time was spent on the story section. The columns were stacking on top of each other. It turns out that I forgot the row class which helps get the elements inline with each other. Tomorrow I'll have to remember to use the row class when I work on the location. I added styles for three sections today. I just need to finish the celebration section then I can start tackling the location one tomorrow. I need to start thinking of how to add JavaScript to this project. I might create a modal for RSVP like the W3Schools example but I'm not sure yet.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding colors for celebration section. Play around with line height and padding.
- Start working on the location section. Use the row class to help get any elements inline with each other.
- Move padding for header text.
- Start thinking about a JavaScript component for the project.

## Day 3: July 7, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add more Bootstrap classes and CSS styles to 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Finished styles for location and info sections.

**Day Summary:** I spent a few minutes trying to fix the padding for the header greeting. I managed to get it centered in the middle of the background image, but I tried getting the text over towards the left so it wasn't covering Emma's face. However I ran into issues with the text editor so I just left it the way it is for now. I might play around with it again later. I added a new p tag in the location section. Out of the two sections I did today, location is where I spent most of my time. I was playing around with the columns, image and text to get all the elements the right size and spaced right. I decided I am going to make a modal for the invitation. Tomorrow I'm going to finish adding styles for the rest of the site before I tackle of the JavaScript. I'll do the responsive design once the JavaScript is all done.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for response section.
- Add Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for footer.
- Start putting together modal. Create a div tag in HTML and start getting JavaScript so it opens when button is clicked.

## Day 4: July 8, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add Bootstrap and CSS styles for response and footer sections. Started to add JavaScript for modal.

**Day Summary:** Response and footer sections are now styled. Most of the time was spent getting started on the modal. I added the modal to my HTML and started adding the styles. I began adding some of the JavaScript to the modal. Right now the modal isn't showing when I click the button so I'm going to have to do some troubleshooting tomorrow. The console is saying the issue is for the close button. Tomorrow I'm going to debug JavaScript and see if I can get it to appear.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix modal JavaScript. Especially the close button. Get the modal to appear on the screen.
- Organize modal HTML.
- Finish CSS for modal.

## Day 5: July 9, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Update HTML, CSS and JavaScript for modal. Tried to get the modal to appear on the screen when button is clicked.

**Day Summary:** I spent 30 minutes working on the modal. I didn't have much success. I did resolve the error with the close button. However the modal is still not appearing on the screen. When I opened Dev Tools, everything is working smoothly. I spent lots of the time looking at JavaScript documentation and reading articles to try different techniques but nothing changed. I think the issue might be in the event listeners and functions. Right now I am trying another tutorial to see if that works. If it doesn't, I'm going to redo the pseudo code and take away the CSS to see if I can get a basic version to appear.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Use documentation from https://hackernoon.com/the-ultimate-guide-for-creating-a-simple-modal-component-in-vanilla-javascript-react-angular-8733e2859b42 to see if modal appears on the screen.

## Day 6: July 10, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Remove JavaScript code I've been using. Rewrote all modal code in HTML. Add links for jQuery and Bootstrap for JavaScript.

**Day Summary:** I spent all my time trying to get the RSVP button to work. The original documentation I was trying to use wasn't working. So I did some googling to see what I could find. In the end, I decided to start over completely. I removed all the CSS and JavaScript code I had written. I began to redo the modal code itself. I read online to add links to the jQuery and Bootstrap JS file so I added those links to see if they would help. Right now I'm going back to using the W3Schools documentation. I'm going to also check out the Bootstrap documentation to see if I can at least get something to appear on the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding modal classes to HTML. Use https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_js_modal.asp to help write code and see if modal code can work.
- Write any JavaScript code to get the RSVP button working.
- Style RSVP button. Currently text is all blue.

## Day 7: July 11, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add jQuery for modal. Began adding styles for the modal.

**Day Summary:** A modal has finally appeared on the site! Initially nothing was appearing after I added the rest of the Bootstrap classes and added the JavaScript in. It turns out the modal didn't have the id set which is why nothing was appearing. As soon as I set the id, a modal appeared on the browser. It was a mess, but it was working. The rest of the time was playing with the CSS. I was having issues styling due the Bootstrap classes I added earlier so I began removing them. This made styling so much easier and less messy.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add JavaScript so button will toggle on and off.
- Figure out how to get the modal in the middle of the page.
- Remove modal-body and modal-footer classes from the modal.
- Finish adding CSS styles for the modal.
- Think about adding more JS for accept and decline buttons in the modal.

## Day 8: July 12, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add more div tags to 30 Days, 30 Sites modal. Update CSS styles. Managed to get modal to toggle on with JavaScript. Began adding JS code to get the modal to close.

**Day Summary:** I finished removing the Bootstrap modal code. I organized the modal code into different div tags for the modal header, body and footer. I started to add more CSS to the modal code. I originally had padding and height set for some of the modal elements but I removed them in order to play around with the .modal padding to see why it was moving the modal into the center of the page. I revisited the W3Schools modal tutorial and began having better luck with adding most of the CSS. I started adding the JavaScript. So far the variables are done. I am getting an error saying the onclick property isn't working so tomorrow I'm going to be doing some debugging to see onclick isn't working despite the button allowing the modal to open when it is clicked.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- fix the onclick property issue from error message.
- Adjust padding and height for modal elements.

## Day 9: July 13, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Fix issues for modal in 30 Days, 30 sites event invitation. Got modal to close. Move modal code closer to the RSVP button.

**Day Summary:** I'm almost in the home stretch with the modal. I figured out why I was getting errors in the console. It turns out that I added the punctuation for the IDs and classes was causing the onclick errors. As soon as I removed the punctuation in the variables, everything started to pass and it began start acting as a modal. The only issue I have now when the modal closes, the backdrop still remains dark. I will try playing around with some of the JS code to see if I can get the backdrop to get back to normal. I started playing with the JS a little bit, but I wasn't having much luck. I think I might have to try setting the data attributes but I'm not 100% sure if that is the right solution.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Think about removing modal close button or find a solution so when the modal is closed, the opacity returns back to normal and doesn't stay in a black background.
- Add CSS for the modal content.

## Day 10: July 14, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Fixed modal backdrop. Tried making responsive styles for 30 Days, 30 sites event invitation. Started set up for next project.

**Day Summary:** I fixed the modal backdrop. After reading some of the documentation and some articles, I decided to just remove the data attributes on the modal button. Once I removed the data attributes I added some background color to the modal. This make a huge difference and would be removed when the modal closed. I tried working on the responsive styles for the site but Dev Tools was acting up. When I was refreshing my site preview, Dev Tools immediately paused the site in the debugger. I tried googling for a solution but I wasn't having much luck. I finally got frustrated and decided to switch gears by starting set up on the next project. Tomorrow I'm going to try again to see if I can get the responsive styles to work in the previewer but if I can't I'll just move onto the next project.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Try figuring out the mobile styles for event invitation.
- Finish set up on tourist attraction website.
- Start working on HTML for new project.

## Day 11: July 15, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes for navbar in 30 Days, 30 Sites invitation. Start adding mobile CSS styles.

**Day Summary:** I did some googling before starting this coding session to see what was going on with Dev Tools. I did manage to get it fixed, but I was just clicking around with elements in the source window. Whatever I did do I fixed everything. During the session, the navbar wasn't fitting on the entire page when it was on a mobile screen. I ended up removing the navbar Bootstrap classes which fixed the problem. I'll just need to use CSS to replicate what I originally had. I started adding the mobile styles to the site. I was originally was going put all the styles in the same style sheet, but I decided to add a CSS folder and create separate files for different stylesheets for each. Right now I'm working on the mobile styles. Biggest issue I have is the input is cutting off near the left side of the screen when the modal is open. Tomorrow I'll see if I can change the CSS so that doesn't happen on the mobile version of the modal.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix input bar in mobile CSS style sheet.
- Add CSS styles for mobile footer section.
- Start adding styles for responsive styles.

## Day 12: July 16, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Tried to fix input for mobile modal. Add styles for responsive version of 30 Days, 30 Sites invitation.

**Day Summary:** Finished the mobile and responsive CSS styles. The input on the mobile still looks like it is being cut off near the left side. I tried fixing the CSS but wasn't having much luck so I'll just leave it the way it is. I did start adding CSS styles for the responsive tablet version of the site. I spent a lot of time deciding on specific Bootstrap classes for the location and story sections. I decided to use col-md-12 instead of col-md-6 since the columns looked as if the images were being squashed together. I added some padding for the p tag in the location section so there was a little bit of space between the image and text. Tomorrow I'm going to tackle the navbar on the desktop version. Without the Bootstrap classes, I'm going to need to figure out how to recreate the same thing using CSS.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix navbar in main style file.
- Add Bootstrap class for large screen.

## Day 13: July 17, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Played around with screen sizes for media attribute in HTML file. Tried getting CSS for main stylesheet to appear on website.

**Day Summary:** I didn't have much luck with getting the navigation to appear. I thought the problem was the screen sizes so I tried playing around with the media attribute in the head tag for all the stylesheets to see if I could fix it this way. It didn't work. In the end, I moved the h1 navbar from the nav and added a class to the row for styling. So far it is working. As I was checking the mobile section, the background image is now moving towards the middle of the page. I'll see if I can get it to move a little bit to the left side of the page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix background image for event invitation so move a little to the left.
- Fix nav code in responsive and main stylesheets.

## Day 14: July 18, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Fixed mobile and responsive stylesheets for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Tried fixing main desktop style sheet.

**Day Summary:** I spent all my time working on the CSS for the invitation. It took some time copying and pasting code but I managed to fix the issues with the mobile website. I managed to get the responsive version done since there weren't too many changes. The one that is proving to be the biggest challenge is the main desktop version. Somehow the styles aren't appearing for the navigation bar. I played with the screen sizes and even removed the links for the main style sheet but the styles I want still aren't appearing. I double checked all my styles for the other two stylesheets and they are working just fine. So tomorrow I'm going to figure out what is wrong with the main stylesheet and get something to appear. I have removed the code I was using and am slowly adding it back to see what my site looks like without any of the styles.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix main stylesheet for desktop. Trying creating a different stylesheet or play around with screen sizes.

## Day 15: July 19, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Fixed main styles for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Double check all HTML, CSS and JS code.

**Day Summary:** I finally finished the event invitation. It turns out that I created another style file not in the assets folder. This code was mixing with the styles in the style.css folder in the assets folder. So I deleted the style file outside of the assets folder and updated the CSS in the style file in the assets folder. This fixed everything and the styles appeared. I did the last checks of all the code files before pushing to the git repo. I ran into problems here and got an error saying "error: cannot stat 'assets/css': Permission denied" so I had to google a bit to figure out what was wrong. I decided the best thing to cod was close out of all my files and text editor then restart everything. As soon as I did this, everything worked just fine. Tomorrow it is time to get back to the tourist attraction website!

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start working on 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction. Get all the set up for the project done.
- Try to start the HTML for tourist attraction website.

## Day 16: July 20, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finished set up for 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Began adding HTML code to index file.

**Day Summary:** I got a good head start on some of the HTML code. It isn't completely done. I finished all the set up. I'm debating on if I should add some JavaScript to this site or not. The plan for this project is working with CSS Flexbox mostly. I still have some Bootstrap because I do want some practice but mostly I'd like to use Flexbox the right way this time. Right now I've added the header and footer for the website. I started adding sections to the website. I'm not quite sure what to add so I did look as some other tourist attraction websites on the website to get an idea of what sections I can add to my site. Hopefully tomorrow I can finish the HTML and get a good start on the CSS.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding HTML code to website. Use the https://www.gohawaii.com/ as reference of what sections to add to the site.
- Find CSS Flexbox resources.
- Decide if I should use JavaScript on this site or not.

## Day 17: July 21, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding HTML sections to 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Began adding CSS styles.

**Day Summary:** I managed to get all the HTML added. I get a feeling I'll be adding more HTML as I go so I'll probably add more as I add more CSS. I started adding CSS to the website. So far I've managed to get some of the navbar done. I'm using some of the colors I used in the original version I made from round one. Right now my plan is to get most of the CSS on the site before I start playing around with Flexbox since that will impact lots of responsive styles. I added a form element in the HTML this time. It won't actually work but I want to practice putting a form element on a website. I'm also using this project to use the iframe tag more by adding sections for Google Maps or video.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for navbar.
- Add CSS styles for greeting section of website. Find a background image for the greeting section.

## Day 18: July 22, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add CSS to header, navbar and discover sections for 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Start adding CSS styles for map.

**Day Summary:** Mostly worked on the CSS styles for 30 Days, 30 Sites for tourist attraction website. I did go back into the HTML a little bit to change two classes into ids as well as adding some Bootstrap classes. I managed to get most of the styles done for header, navbar and discover sections. I spent a lot of time trying to get the header background image and text just right. It took more padding than I expected to get the h2 headline in the center of the page. Biggest thing I've learned today is to keep headlines out of the row div tag. The row class causes the headlines and any elements that follow it to be mixed up all over the page. Putting the headlines outside of the row class prevents this from happening and allows Bootstrap to get the columns just right.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for map section. Find right height and width for map.
- Start adding styles for video section.

## Day 19: July 23, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Added styles for map, video and festivals sections. Tried adding margin and padding between discover elements.

**Day Summary:** Mostly used CSS for today's activities. At the beginning of the session I went back into the discover section and tried adding some padding between the three p tags so there was a little more space between them. It didn't work so I just left them the way they are for now. I spent most of the time working on the map, video and festivals section. The iframe tags were a little bit harder to style than I anticipated. I found myself spending lots of time moving back and forth between the width and height to get everything looking just right. Padding proved to be a big issue for the festivals section. I spent a lot of time adjusting the padding so the text wasn't near the top of the background image.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Create ul tags for directory links. Put a tags inside li tags.
- Finish adding styles to the directory section.
- Add styles to the footer. Add background color. Change size and color for social media icons.
- Set up for responsive styles.

## Day 20: July 24, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles to main style file. Create new stylesheets for responsive styles. Started adding styles for mobile version of site.

**Day Summary:** I got the main stylesheet finished with all the styles. Although these styles are done, I commented them out in the index file to play around with the Flexbox. I'm not sure if Flexbox will be 100% effective with Bootstrap so I'm debating on deleting Bootstrap off this project and just using Flexbox only. I started to play around with Flexbox on the mobile of the site. It is taking me awhile since I'm using the CSS Tricks blog to review the properties. I did decide this website won't have any JavaScript so I can give all my attention on getting Flexbox working on the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Use Flexbox documentation from https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ to start adding Flexbox to website.
- Get the mobile version of the header done.

## Day 21: July 25, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add more CSS to mobile stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Add Bootstrap classes for small screens in HTML file.

**Day Summary:** I did some googling before starting this session and it turns out that Flexbox is already included in Bootstrap 4 so I don't need to add more Flexbox classes to this site. Therefore I'm going to just use this project as a way to get more practice with Bootstrap. The next project will be the Flexbox project without any Bootstrap. Mostly worked with the CSS today. Mobile CSS is almost done. I just need to finish adding CSS to two sections and it will be done. I had some issues checking the preview in Dev Tools. The previewer looked as if it was cutting off parts of my site. Eventually I just exited out of the previewer view and played with the window sizes with Dev Tools on to double check my styles. Tomorrow before I start the responsive styles I'm going to use the previewer one last time to see how everything looks.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding CSS for directory and footer sections on mobile stylesheet.
- Start adding styles for responsive stylesheet.
- Double check on how mobile version of the site looks using Dev Tools.

## Day 22: July 26, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding CSS styles to 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website.

**Day Summary:** I finished the tourist attraction website. I added the remaining CSS styles for mobile, responsive and main stylesheets. I checked the previewer in Dev Tools to see how everything looked on the screen. I had no problems with the previewer today. Only HTML I added were the Bootstrap classes for medium and large screens. I didn't have to make too many tweaks to the CSS but I did use the CSS to play around with the width and height of the iframe, video and input tags.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start project set up for day four of 30 Days, 30 sites.
- Do not add Bootstrap to day four project! Will be using the project to practice Flexbox.

## Day 23: July 27, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Started to set up 30 Days, 30 Sites product website. Created new stylesheets. Began adding HTML code for header, footer, navigation and some of the website sections.

**Day Summary:** Today was all about setting up for the project and getting everything ready. This mean setting up the Github repo, organizing CSS folders, getting all the links needed to make this project and more. I'm not using Bootstrap on this project and am going to instead use Flexbox. Right now the focus is on getting the HTML on the page. The challenge with this website is trying to figure out what Mr. Gold would want on his website. I started looking at a couple of examples to get an idea of what to possibly put. So far I'm planning on using the images from the round one version of the site but it is hard knowing what to put on the website since he's a mysterious character on the show so I'm going to look at a few real life examples to see how to model this website for Mr. Gold.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add more li tags for navigation bar if possible.
- Add sections in main tag. Add a section note from the Golds, images from the round one version, and an image of the building location. Possibly add a section about Mr. Gold and find image for Mr. Gold.
- Look at more examples of pawnbroker websites to get an idea what else might be on the website.
- Think about adding JavaScript to this website.

## Day 24: July 28, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add new sections to 30 Days, 30 Sites product site HTML code. Start adding CSS styles for mobile stylesheet.

**Day Summary:** I added most of the HTML to the product site. I found a pawnshop website that I liked online and used it as a influence for Mr. Gold's website. I add a couple more links to the navigation. The rest of the time was adding the rest of the sections to the website. I deleted a section planned for the location and moved it up near the top near the logo area. I was able to added a note from the Gold family and created the preview section which included images from the round one website. I did get a head start on the mobile CSS by adding some of the basic styles. Tomorrow I'm still planning on doing the styles but I might add some more HTML sections to the site as well as extra classes to help work with flexbox.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add a section to the HTML for Mr. Gold and Belle's pictures. Name as who are we.
- Add more styles to mobile CSS style sheet. Use https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-3496/ for adding colors to the website.
- Start playing around with Flexbox properties.
