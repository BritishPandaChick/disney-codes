## Day 1: July 5, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for navbar on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Started adding styles for header.

**Day Summary:** I was trying to figure out how to style the navbar. The links were still stacked up on each other so I was playing around with the Bootstrap classes. I was trying to use the documentation examples to troubleshoot the issues. Eventually I managed to get the link elements to be inline with each other by rearranging the Bootstrap classes. I did start adding styles for the header. Tomorrow I will concentrate on getting the header to work particularly getting the text in the middle of the background image if possible.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for the header. Try to figure out how to center text in the middle of background image.
- Use https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-3810/ to add more styles for story section.

## Day 2: July 6, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Added Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for header, story and celebration sections on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation page.

**Day Summary:** I finished the header. Although I used some of my original code from the first round of 100 Days of Code, I played around with the styles for the background image. A lot of time was spent on the story section. The columns were stacking on top of each other. It turns out that I forgot the row class which helps get the elements inline with each other. Tomorrow I'll have to remember to use the row class when I work on the location. I added styles for three sections today. I just need to finish the celebration section then I can start tackling the location one tomorrow. I need to start thinking of how to add JavaScript to this project. I might create a modal for RSVP like the W3Schools example but I'm not sure yet.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding colors for celebration section. Play around with line height and padding.
- Start working on the location section. Use the row class to help get any elements inline with each other.
- Move padding for header text.
- Start thinking about a JavaScript component for the project.

## Day 3: July 7, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add more Bootstrap classes and CSS styles to 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Finished styles for location and info sections.

**Day Summary:** I spent a few minutes trying to fix the padding for the header greeting. I managed to get it centered in the middle of the background image, but I tried getting the text over towards the left so it wasn't covering Emma's face. However I ran into issues with the text editor so I just left it the way it is for now. I might play around with it again later. I added a new p tag in the location section. Out of the two sections I did today, location is where I spent most of my time. I was playing around with the columns, image and text to get all the elements the right size and spaced right. I decided I am going to make a modal for the invitation. Tomorrow I'm going to finish adding styles for the rest of the site before I tackle of the JavaScript. I'll do the responsive design once the JavaScript is all done.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for response section.
- Add Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for footer.
- Start putting together modal. Create a div tag in HTML and start getting JavaScript so it opens when button is clicked.

## Day 3: July 7, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add Bootstrap and CSS styles for response and footer sections. Started to add JavaScript for modal.

**Day Summary:** Response and footer sections are now styled. Most of the time was spent getting started on the modal. I added the modal to my HTML and started adding the styles. I began adding some of the JavaScript to the modal. Right now the modal isn't showing when I click the button so I'm going to have to do some troubleshooting tomorrow. The console is saying the issue is for the close button. Tomorrow I'm going to debug JavaScript and see if I can get it to appear.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix modal JavaScript. Especially the close button. Get the modal to appear on the screen.
- Organize modal HTML.
- Finish CSS for modal.
