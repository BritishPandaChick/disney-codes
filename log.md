## Day 1: June 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** I removed all my old project code. I set up code files with new Google Fonts link, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap. I added code for the navigation and began adding code for sections.

**Day Summary:** I decided to completely redo the entire website for this project. This project is going to use Sass so I decided to keep things fairly simple for this site so I can concentrate on Sass. Most of the work was just removing the old code I had from the previous challenge and getting the items I need (i.e. Google Fonts, Font Awesome) ready to go. I didn't dabble with any Sass yet, but I did use the documentation to get my files set up for when I get to Sass later this week. I will search Sass on The Practical Dev to get tips from other developers on using Sass. Today my focus was just getting the HTML code started. The header is done. I just need to decide on what sections to add on the landing page. So I might use my original version as inspiration as well as google some to see what I could add to the home page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding all HTML code to HTML file.
- Look at The Practical Dev for Sass articles.
- Google Photographer websites for inspiration.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Change headlines for banner. Change image for about section. Remove old code for images and created a gallery of six images. Started adding footer.

**Day Summary:** I did a lot of research on photographer websites before working on today's project to get a sense of what items could go on the landing page. After looking at different examples, I updated the code I did yesterday by adding an extra headline in the banner. Although there isn't a background image, I put a link to the background image I want to use in the scss file later. The rest of the time was spent updating img tags with new images. I'm using the Free Code Camp gallery image tutorial to make a gallery on the website. I added all the HTML tags for the gallery. I started to add the footer so I'm ready to start working on the styles tomorrow. However I think tomorrow's session will be playing around with Sass and making sure I can get it working using the Sass documentation as well as articles I find on The Practical Dev.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding code for footer section
- Try to get Sass to work for code files

## Day 3: June 3, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Start playing around with Sass on code files. Began adding styles for mobile version of site. Finish adding HTML to footer.

**Day Summary:** All the HTML is done. I added a few icons for social media graphics. One of the images wasn't working on my gallery so I fixed the issue. The rest of the time was spent working on getting Sass to work. Initially it wasn't working so I removed the app and public folders then moved the folder contents into my root directory. This made everything work and my test styles were appearing on the site. The rest of the time was spent playing around with Sass to try making the mobile styles of my site. The challenge was trying to get the header background color to change. I changed the Bootstrap classes and played around with nested code but I wasn't having much luck. So I decided to keep things simple and scrapped the background color. I did get a head start on the banner section where I began playing around with the headlines. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get find a way to move the headlines down so they are centered in the page and might revisit working on the header styles to see if I can get them to work. Hopefully I'll be able to get to the image gallery tomorrow and get the mobile version of the mobile gallery working.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to fix header styles 
- Finish adding styles for banner
- Find a way to fix background image for banner
- Start adding styles for image gallery
