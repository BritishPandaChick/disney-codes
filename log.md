## Day 1: June 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** I removed all my old project code. I set up code files with new Google Fonts link, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap. I added code for the navigation and began adding code for sections.

**Day Summary:** I decided to completely redo the entire website for this project. This project is going to use Sass so I decided to keep things fairly simple for this site so I can concentrate on Sass. Most of the work was just removing the old code I had from the previous challenge and getting the items I need (i.e. Google Fonts, Font Awesome) ready to go. I didn't dabble with any Sass yet, but I did use the documentation to get my files set up for when I get to Sass later this week. I will search Sass on The Practical Dev to get tips from other developers on using Sass. Today my focus was just getting the HTML code started. The header is done. I just need to decide on what sections to add on the landing page. So I might use my original version as inspiration as well as google some to see what I could add to the home page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding all HTML code to HTML file.
- Look at The Practical Dev for Sass articles.
- Google Photographer websites for inspiration.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Change headlines for banner. Change image for about section. Remove old code for images and created a gallery of six images. Started adding footer.

**Day Summary:** I did a lot of research on photographer websites before working on today's project to get a sense of what items could go on the landing page. After looking at different examples, I updated the code I did yesterday by adding an extra headline in the banner. Although there isn't a background image, I put a link to the background image I want to use in the scss file later. The rest of the time was spent updating img tags with new images. I'm using the Free Code Camp gallery image tutorial to make a gallery on the website. I added all the HTML tags for the gallery. I started to add the footer so I'm ready to start working on the styles tomorrow. However I think tomorrow's session will be playing around with Sass and making sure I can get it working using the Sass documentation as well as articles I find on The Practical Dev.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding code for footer section
- Try to get Sass to work for code files

## Day 3: June 3, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Start playing around with Sass on code files. Began adding styles for mobile version of site. Finish adding HTML to footer.

**Day Summary:** All the HTML is done. I added a few icons for social media graphics. One of the images wasn't working on my gallery so I fixed the issue. The rest of the time was spent working on getting Sass to work. Initially it wasn't working so I removed the app and public folders then moved the folder contents into my root directory. This made everything work and my test styles were appearing on the site. The rest of the time was spent playing around with Sass to try making the mobile styles of my site. The challenge was trying to get the header background color to change. I changed the Bootstrap classes and played around with nested code but I wasn't having much luck. So I decided to keep things simple and scrapped the background color. I did get a head start on the banner section where I began playing around with the headlines. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get find a way to move the headlines down so they are centered in the page and might revisit working on the header styles to see if I can get them to work. Hopefully I'll be able to get to the image gallery tomorrow and get the mobile version of the mobile gallery working.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to fix header styles 
- Finish adding styles for banner
- Find a way to fix background image for banner
- Start adding styles for image gallery

## Day 4: June 4, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Rearrange code for about section. Add headline to Spider Man gallery of images and Bootstrap classes for the images. Fix banner and header sections.

**Day Summary:** I found myself spending more time working in the HTML file than with Sass today. I added lots of Bootstrap classes for the gallery images and the headlines in the banner section. I decided to rearrange the about section by switching the spots for the image and text. The last major addition was a headline tag for the gallery section. The styles are almost done for the mobile version. Before I started to add styles to the other sections I did play around with the header a bit to see if I could my original vision for the site to work. It took some playing with the Bootstrap classes but I managed to get the background color I wanted by removing bg-dark command. Tomorrow I just need to finish the header then I'm going to start working on the styles for the tablet.scss file.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for mobile footer section
- Start adding styles to tablet stylesheet

## Day 5: June 5, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish footer styles for mobile version of site. Start adding styles for medium and large size screens. Played around with Bootstrap classes. Fix issues with Font Awesome icons.

**Day Summary:** The mobile styles are done. At first I was having issues getting the Font Awesome icons to appear on the site. Initially all I had were bullet points with no icons. I had to play around with the HTML code a bit but I found that when I added the Bootstrap nav classes the icons would reappear. I did make the mistake of not starting the compiler in the terminal today so I spent 5 minutes trying to figure out why my styles weren't appearing on my site. So I need to remember from now on to start Sass first thing when I begin working on a project. The rest of the time was adding styles to the tablet.scss. I did get a headstart on styles in style.scss file, but I want to double check all my styles in tablet.scss first before I finish all the styles for large screens. Tomorrow I'd like to get some of the styles added to the image gallery. I'll be interested to see if the styles I want to add will conflict with the Bootstrap classes. 

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles to tablet.scss
- Resume adding styles to style.scss
- Use Free Code Camp image gallery article to make gallery

## Day 6: June 6, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes for gallery. Add new gallery styles for mobile and tablet sylesheets. Start adding more styles to style.scss for large screens.

**Day Summary:** The photographer website is almost done. All the tablet.scss styles have been added and compiled to the site. The rest of the time was spent finishing the styles for style.scss file. It turns out that Bootstrap doesn't work very well with the styles from the Free Code Camp image gallery guide. So I removed the Bootstrap classes in the gallery class. This mean adding new class styles in my other stylesheets to get the similar effects from the Bootstrap classes. I double checked the mobile and tablet versions of the sites and they look the way they need to. But the gallery is still an issue since the images are lined up next to each other instead of being spaced out on the page. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get the gallery styles to work on my site. If not, I'll add back the Bootstrap and find a different layout for the images.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix gallery styles for all site versions
- Finish adding styles to style.scss file

## Day 7: June 7, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for photographer website. Start preparing code files for mobile services and events website. Began adding Bootstrap and HTML code for header.

**Day Summary:** I figured out the issue with my gallery on the photographer website. I set display to flex instead of grid for the gallery class. This was causing the images to line up next to each other. Once I made this change, the images started to be in a grid except for one image. I looked through my code and noticed I was missing a class. Once I added the styles for the gallery, the image size changed to fit on the screen. After double checking my styles, I started preparing code for the next 30 Days, 30 Websites project. I got the files organized and was able to start working on the header. Tomorrow I'm thinking of moving the headline of the site above or underneath the navigation. I will play around with the navigation and see what might look best for the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish HTML for header on mobile services website
- Add Bootstrap code to other sections

## Day 8: June 8, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add new images to meet section. Remove social media section and move code to footer age. Update bottom navigation menu with Bootstrap classes. Started to make e-mail section and build a new form. Move styles from style.css to mobile.scss file.

**Day Summary:** I made a lot of progress working on the HTML. Before I started working on this project, I took a couple of minutes to take a look at CodePen to see what other creators considered a mobile service and event. After seeing those ideas, I decided to stick with my original concept but put in as many Disney references as I could. So I removed some o the images and text tags with newer ones. I deleted a section I had for social media and moved the content to the footer. I am keeping some of the older sections, but these sections are getting more Bootstrap. The header is finished. I decided to move the headline out of the div row. Once I start with the styling, I might move the code around some more later. Right now I'm working on trying to make a form for the e-mail near the bottom of the page. i might move this section up near the top of the page tomorrow, but for now my challenge is getting the form on the site and getting the button done. Tomorrow I will play with more of the Bootstrap classes to see if I can get some spacing between the form elements.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish making form for e-mail section
- Add a section for food truck highlight

## Day 9: June 9, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding HTML to mobile events and service site. Currently trying to figure out how to get Sass to work on the new site.

**Day Summary:** I fixed the issues with the form. I had to use more Bootstrap class for each of the form elements so the elements would be inline and have some spacing in between themselves. After making the form button, I added a section for the highlight section then rearranged the website layout a bit by moving the email section near the top. Now that the HTML is all done, I began working on Sass for the mobile site. Right now the styles are not connecting on the site. I did a test with some code with the main style file but none of the styles were appearing. I'll see if I can quickly troubleshoot the issue tomorrow so I can start adding styles.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Get Sass to work
- Add styles for the base styles for mobile site
- Begin adding Header styles for mobile site

## Day 10: June 10, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Got Sass to work and compile styles. Began adding styles for mobile header of site.

**Day Summary:** Most of my time was spent trying to Sass to work on the site. I used the documentation to double check everything I was doing. I was able to get my test styles working on the large screen version, but none of the styles were being compiled on the other versions of the site. After playing around with the files and changing around the links to the stylesheet, everything started working the way it needed to. I was able to get a start on some of the mobile styles. I changed my mind on the navigation so I did add Bootstrap classes back into the site. I also changed the site title to the site so it would look alongside the button for the navbar on the mobile site. Tomorrow I'll see if I can finish the mobile styles and see how things look on the site before I start adding more styles to the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles to mobile header
- Start adding styles to email section

## Day 11: June 11, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for header on mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites mobile events and services site. Start adding styles for email and meet sections.

**Day Summary:** Today's session was just working on styles. After finishing the header styles, I took a look at the header and decided the colors made it too hard to see anything on a site. So I switched up some of the Sass variables and changed the colors so they were darker. This made a huge difference and was much easier to read. I was able to start adding styles for two sections on the page. The padding was an issue on the page so I started to adjust the Bootstrap classes to see if it would help. I wrapped the contents of the meet seciton in a div with the container class and changed the image classes. Tomorrow I'll see if there any more styles I need to add to the email and meet sections so I can start adding styles for the highlight and footer navigation. I might need to play around with the Bootstrap classes for the footer nav so I'll be playing around with the HTML more tomorrow to get the bottom navigation just right for my site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish add styles for meet section
- Start adding styles for highlight section

## Day 12: June 12, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles to mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites mobile events and services website. Began adding styles to tablet version of header.

**Day Summary:** The mobile version of the site is officially done on my site. When I started the session, I took a couple of minutes to change the font size of the button on my meet section and double check the styles for my meet section. Then I started adding the styles for the highlight section and updating some of the Bootstrap classes in the index.html file. It took a couple of minutes playing around with the Bootstrap classes, but managed to make to the footer navigation work the way I work. This might change as I work on the styles for different screen sizes but for now all the styles are working the way I want. Once the header was finished, I double checked to see how my site looked. I'm not 100% a fan of the h3 and p content in the highlight section, but for now it works the way I want. I was able to start adding code to the tablet.scss file. I was able to get the header styles added to the tablet version of the site. Tomorrow I just need to double check any of the styles I have so far before I can move onto styling for the other sections.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Double check header styles on tablet stylesheet
- Start adding styles to email and meet sections

## Day 13: June 13, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for tablet.scss. Try to fix Bootstrap classes so bottom navigation would work on mobile sites and not clash with styles for medium and large screens.

**Day Summary:** All the tablet.scss styles are added and compiled on the site. I spent a lot of trying to fix the padding for the form button. I tried playing around with the padding for the button since the right side is a little too close to the texxt. I wasn't able to fix the button. I think some of the Bootstrap classes could be preventing the styles from being changed so I'll have to play around with button styles on the tablet version sometime in the future. After spending some time trying to fix the email button, I decided to move onto the rest of the styles. It turns out that the Bootstrap classes were causing problems for the bottom navigation on the tablet version of my site so I had to remove the Bootstrap classes I added yesterday. Instead of adjusting the columns, I just wrapped the tags in divs with the container and row classes. This gave me the navigation look I wanted on the tablet file, but it messed up the styles for my mobile styles. Tomorrow if I have some extra time I'd like to try adding some Flexbox properties to the mobile bottom navigation to see if I can get the effect I had before without using Bootstrap classes.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start add styles for style.scss
- Go back and fix site issues for bottom navigation and email button

## Day 14: June 14, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles to style.scss file and compile styles to site. Update multiple sections in mobile.scss file. Add link tag inside h1 tag in header in index.html.

**Day Summary:** All the styles are now added to the website. I didn't make too many changes to the style.scss file since I wanted to concentrate on getting the mobile.scss style updates started. The rest of the session was spent working on getting the mobile styles updated. Today I managed to get the header, email, meet, and highlight sections done. These sections didn't have too many changes except adding padding to headlines and images so there was a little more spacing between the elements. This made things look better and fixed some of the issues I was having with the highlight section. I wasn't able to get to the bottom navigation, but tomorrow I'll spend my time playing around with Flexbox and see if the properties will help. If they don't, I'll need to rethink my plan.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to fix bottom navigation on mobile site
- Add final style changes to mobile footer

## Day 15: June 15, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes from bottom navigation section. Tried getting bullet points to disappear with text-decoration property. Add headline for bottom navigation.

**Day Summary:** Today I spent all my time working on the styles for the bottom navigation. I played around with Flexbox as best as I could but I decided it was best to remove all the Bootstrap classes. Once all the Bootstrap was removed, I redid the bottom navigation HTML. I might try Flexbox again tomorrow to see if I can get the Flexbox to work on the site. However, the biggest issue I've having now is getting the bullet points to be hidden on the page. The text decoration property isn't working right now. I think this could be the way the tags are nested in the bottom navigation section so I'm going to play around with the tags tomorrow to see if I can find out where the problem is.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to get text-decoration property to work on bottom-nav list
- Do final updates for mobile footer
- Start adding style updates for tablet.scss file

## Day 16: June 16, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish mobile styles for mobile events services website. Add final style updates for tablet.scss file. Start adding styles to style.scss file.

**Day Summary:** After taking at look at my code and playing around with the properties, I was able to get the bottom navigation to work on the mobile site. What I did was make an li selector which uses the list-style-type set to none and padding set to 10px 0. I nested the a and a:hover selector inside. This hid all the bullet points. Once I changed the padding, I added the style updates for the footer before I moving to the tablet.scss file. I ran into more issues with the button in the email section. I removed my initial styles and tried to change the padding on the sides but it would move the padding much farther than I wanted no matter what I did. I decided to just leave the button style the way it is and move on with the rest of the styling. When I got to the bottom navigation in the tablet.scss file, I played around around with Flexbox properties just to see how the elements would look on the page. I eventually just set the display to flex for the ul items and added some padding to left of the li elements to create the bottom navigation in the tablet.scss. I was able to get a headstart on the style.scss styles. The header as a bit of challenge just getting the spacing of the navigation items just right but I added some padding to the left of the li elements to get some spacing in between elements so they weren't too close to the headline. Tomorrow I'm going to finish adding style updates to style.scss then I'll start setting up the code for the next project.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for style.scss file
- Start adding HTML to club website

## Day 17: June 17, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles for large screen version of mobile events and services website. Tried adjusting code section to remove horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of page.

**Day Summary:** I wasn't able to start working on the next project. The updates for the style.scss file are taking longer than I was planning. As I was updating styles, I noticed there was a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of page. So I spent the entire session trying to figure out which section was creating the scroll bar. I wasn't able to get the scroll bar to disappear after looking at each of the sections. I double checked how the other versions looked and I didn't see any horizontal scroll bars so tomorrow I'm going to remove all the styles from style.scss file then slowly add styles back to the page to see what might cause the scroll bar to pop up.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to remove horizontal scroll bar on large screen version of site
- Start adding HTML to club website

## Day 18: June 18, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Tried to remove horizontal scroll bar from large screen version of mobile events and services site.

**Day Summary:** I spent the entire session trying to fix the large screen version of my site and remove the horizontal scroll bar. I removed all the styles from the style.scss file to see if I could find the problem. Instead I think I discovered the issue might have come from the index.html file instead. I wasn't able to figure out what the issue is. So tomorrow I'm going to play around with the HTML and see what code is creating the horizontal scroll bar. Once I figure out the issue and fix it, I'll add the styles back to the style.scss file. I'll have to double check the mobile and tablet versions to see if there are any fixes that need to be made before I move onto another project.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Remove HTML code to see what might be causing the horizontal scroll bar 
- Add back in styles for style.scss

## Day 19: June 19, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add container class to footer. Add styles back to style.scss file. Begin setting up club project code.

**Day Summary:** I figured out what was causing the error on the large screen mobile events and services website. I removed all my HTML code and added each section back in the file one at a time after I checked how everything looked on the browser. It turns out that it was the footer creating the horizontal bar on the page. I fixed the issue by wrapping the contents of the footer in a div tag with the container class. After I fixed the issue, I double checked to see how everything looked on other versions of my site to see if there were any issues I needed to fix. Happily there were no big issues in these versions so I was finally able to turn my attention to my next project. Tomorrow I'm going to begin working on the HTML code for the new site and see if there is any of my old code I'll be keeping for the new version.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start adding HTML code for header section of club project site

**Link(s) for the day's work:** [30 Days 30 Sites Mobile Services and Events](https://github.com/BritishPandaChick/30sites-mobile-events)

## Day 20: June 20, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Remove old HTML code. Add HTML code for header, footer, clubs, opening, and banner sections. Start adding images to clubs section.

**Day Summary:** After taking a look at my code, I decided to scrap all my current code and add new code to my site. So I removed the HTML and CSS code. The rest of the time was spent adding new HTML code to my site. I set up the header navigation and the footer for the web page. I was able to start adding different sections to the web page. I got quite a few sections on the page done including ones for a banner, news, and opening. Right now I'm working on adding images for a clubs section. Tomorrow I will see if I can finish the rest of the HTML. I have a couple of other sections I'd like to add to my site before I can start working the styles.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add images for clubs section 
- Add announcements section
- Create a form near top of the page

## Day 21: June 21, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding HTML code to club website. Add final images to clubs section. Create email section with a form.

**Day Summary:** The HTML code is finished for the site. I added the images to the clubs section and created an e-mail section at the top of the page. I tried making an announcements section, but I decided to scrap that idea since it was too close to how the news section looked. Most the additions I made today were just text tags and buttons. The opening section has a paragraph tag while I added more headlines and buttons to the clubs section. Tomorrow I'm going to start working on the styles. My big goal is to just make sure the Sass code is working so I'm going to add some test styles to see if everything works before I start adding styles to the mobile version of the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Get Sass test code to work
- Start adding styles for mobile.scss file

## Day 22: June 22, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add test code to double check Sass was working. Began adding styles for mobile version of club site. Add styles for header, banner, and opening section. Start adding styles for news section.

**Day Summary:** Today was the beginning of all the styling for the club website. Before I started working on mobile styles, I added some test styles to the style.scss file to see if Sass was working. Once the test styles were working, I spent the rest of the time working on the mobile styles. I managed to get the header, banner, opening, and email sections done. The header was a bit of challenge since the font colors weren't appearing on the site. This was due to the bg-light and navbar-light classes on the nav tag. Once I changed the navbar-light to navbar-dark the text color changed for the styles I wanted. I got a head start on styles for the news section. Tomorrow I will finish adding the styles to the mobile site and double check my styles before I move onto the styles for the tablet.scss file.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for mobile.scss file 
- Start adding styles for tablet.scss file

## Day 23: June 23, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles for news, clubs, and footer section on mobile.scss. Add styles for tablet.scss file.

**Day Summary:** I finished the styles for the mobile version of the site. Once all the mobile styles were finished, I double checked how everything looked on the mobile version before I started to add styles for the tablet.scss file. I managed to get all the tablet.scss styles done, but I'm not 100% happy with the video in the opening section for the tablet.scss file. I played with the width and height of the iframe tag but I still wasn't satisfied with how everything looked in the browser. Once I'm done with all the styles I will go back and see if I can find a better way to show the video on the medium screen version of the site. Tomorrow I am going to add the styles to the style.scss then double check all my styles for all versions of my site to fix any style issues and try to get the video to work on my site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start adding styles for style.scss file
- Double check styles for all version of club pages
- Set up code files for Beverage website

## Day 24: June 24, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles for style.scss file. Update styles for mobile.scss. Remove headlines from opening section. Add strong tags to new section headlines.

**Day Summary:** I added all the styles for style.scss file. I didn't make too many adjustments to the style.scss file since I would be making changes later as I made final changes. Instead I concentrated on doing the final style updates. After looking at the site, I removed the headlines from the opening section and added strong tags to the headlines in the news section in the HTML code. Once i changed the HTML, I started to update the mobile styles by removing my original code for the headlines in the opening section and adding padding to different HTML elements and changing the font sizes for the headlines. After compiling the styles for the mobile version of the site, I started to add styles for the headever and navigation in the tablet.scss file. Tomorrow I'm going to finish the style updates for the tablet.scss and see if I can figure out how to improve the look of the video.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish style updates for tablet.scss file
- Finish style updates for style.scss file
- Set up code files for Beverage website

## Day 25: June 25, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add final style updates for tablet.scss and style.scss files. Add text-center class to clubs section in index.html. Start setting up code files for Beverage website.

**Day Summary:** Today I made the final style updates for the clubs website. These changes included changing te padding on different sections, changing the margins on buttons, and updating the font sizes. I finished the style updates for tablet.scss file. The video on the tablet.scss isn't perfect. I played around with the width and height for the iframe in the tablet.scss file as best as I could to get the video to look better. I think the issue with video is due to the Bootstrap classes I'm using for the container and row classes. In the future I might change the width and padding for some of the Bootstrap classees to see if that helps with the width and height of the video. Once all styles were finished for tablet.scss, I made final changes for the style.scss file. As I made changes to the style.scss file, I noticed I kept using the text-align property for the h2 headline in the clubs section. So I went back into my HTML and added the text-center to the headline. I went back into all my scss files and removed the text-align property.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Set up code files for Beverage website

## Day 26: June 26, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Organize code files for Beverages website. Remove old code from round one. Start adding new code to index.html file.

**Day Summary:** Today I started to code the Beverage website. I spent a lot of this session getting organized and getting the code files ready. For this project, I won't be using Bootstrap and will instead use the project as a way to get better using Flexbox. Once I organized my code files, I removed all my old HTML & CSS code. I spent the rest of the session working on the HTML code. I did paste some of my code from the first round back into certain sections of site, but I will change up these elements tomorrow. Tomorrow I will be wrapping up the rest of the HTML code so I can start working on the mobile styles. Although I'm using Flexbox, I'm going to continue to use Sass to get more practice using the features beyond the Sass variables.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding HTML code to index.html file
- Start adding styles for mobile.scss file

## Day 27: June 27, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish HTML code for index.html. Rearrange existing code and add new sections for Beverage website. Start adding styles for mobile.scss.

**Day Summary:** Before I started working on my site, I spent some time looking at color palettes and found a brand new color palette to use for my site since I was going to start working on the styles later. First, I finished all the HTML code. I updated a lot of the sections I added yesterday by updating headlines, adding buttons, and moving certain elements to different div tags. I also added a lot of new HTML code including new sections for email and announcements. I've seen a lot of websites have a banner at the top of page above the navigation so this is my way to trying to recreate that on a site. I was able to start on some of the mobile styles. Right now the header had some spacing between the announements section and the top. I will play around with the styles tomorrow to see if I can get the spacing to disappear. My goal is to get a good chunk of the header tomorrow. I'm not sure how I'm going to tackle the navigation quite yet. I might try recreating the mobile navigation I often use on Bootstrap, but a part of me is leaning towards a different direction. I'm going to take a look at different sites on my phone later to get an idea of how to tackle the mobile navigation for my beverage site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for mobile announcements section
- Add styles for h1 headline tag styled
- Start styling mobile header navigation

## Day 28: June 28, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles for announcements section in mobile.scss file. Start adding styles for header section.

**Day Summary:** The announcements section is finished on the mobile version of the site. I figured out how to remove the spacing above the announcements section. What I did was move the announcements section HTML out of the header section. In the mobile.scss file, I gave some padding to the top and bottom of the announcements section. This cauesd the gap between the section and the top of the page to disappear. Once the announcement section was fixed, I started to add styles for the header. I originally was going to have a background color for this section, but I'm wondering if I should just leave the header black and white instead using a background color since the email section will have a background color so too many background colors might be over doing things. Tomorrow I'm going to try using a border to see how that looks once all the navigation is done. Especially figuring out how to get the button to work on the mobile site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for header navigation
- Start styling email section

## Day 29: June 29, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish styles for mobile header. Start adding styles for email section in mobile.scss file.

**Day Summary:** I spent a lot of time working on the mobile header. I played around as best as I could with the navigation to get the list items closer to the left side as I could. This involved playing around with the margin on the ul tag as well as the padding for the li items. The other element I spent time styling was the button for the header. It took some time playing around with the button width and border radius, but I managed to get a decent button on the site. I initially went with a border for the header, but I decided it was best not to have a border on the site. I was able to start the email section and get some of the styles added to the section. I'm not sure how to tackle the form section so tomorrow I'll be working on the form styles so the spacing is just right between the inputs.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add styles for form inputs and button
- Start adding styles for featured section

## Day 30: June 30, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish styles for email in mobile.scss file. Add styles for featured section.

**Day Summary:** The email section is offically done. I spent a lot of time trying to get the form just right. This mean playing around with the margin and padding for the inputs. I used a separate id to style the button. Initially the styles weren't appearing for the button so I had to do some troubleshooting. I realized the width property was creating problems for different the sections which was creating horizontal scroll bars. So I deleted the width property. Although I spent a lot of time in the mobile.scss file, I did make some adjustments to the index.html. One of the biggest changes is updating the image link in the image tag. Tomorrow I'm going to see if I can get more sections styled. Hopefully I can get more styles done for the mobile.scss file so I can start working on styles for tablet.scss file.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start styling popular section
- Change images in popular section

## Day 31: July 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add remaining styles for mobile.scss file. Add styles for medium screens in tablet.scss file. Update images links in index.html file.

**Day Summary:** I made a lot of good progress on the beverage website today. I finished the styles for the mobile.scss file. I took a look at the mobile site before I started coding and wasn't happy with how some of my elements were too close to the left side of the page. So I went back into some of the previous sections to adjust the padding and margin of elements. I especially did this with the input elements on the forms and changed the margin so I pushed them closer towards the middle of the section. I also changed some of the button colors I had for the featured sections so they were green instead of red. In the HTML file, I changed the image links. Once the mobile styles were done, I was able to add all the styles to tablet.scss file. I made a few changes to the padding and margin on elements. I was originally going to change the header and use Flebox, but I decided not to based on how the navigation looked at the tablet version of the site. I might try Flexbox tomorrow on the header in the tablet.scss file to see I can get it to work when I do final style updates.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add styles for style.scss file
- Make final style changes for the site

## Day 32: July 2, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Start adding styles for large screen version of beverage website. Use Flexbox properties to update base styles and header. Start adding styles for email section.

**Day Summary:** I started to add styles to the style.scss file. During this session, I was able to get the styles for the announcements and header done. I found myself going back through the base styles and making minor adjustments so the styles would work with Flexbox. I'm using the CSS Tricks blog post to help me with Flexbox as I add properties into certain sections. It isn't 100% perfect but so far I've been able to create the effects I want with the header. I owe a lot of this to adding extra classes to help with the styling. I added the full-width, half-width, and third-width classes to the HTML to wrap certain elements in. Right now my challenge is getting form just right. The inputs are too close together so I've been trying to use Flexbox properties to see if I can space the items out mroe without using the margin and padding. Tomorrow i'm going to see I can find a solution for the form styles.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out margin and padding for form in email section
- Start styling the featured section

## Day 33: July 3, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for large screen version of the site. Start style updates for mobile.scss file.

**Day Summary:** I spent the rest of the session working on getting the styles on the style.scss file. I played around with Flexbox properties, but I had better luck changing around the padding and margin of elements. I made more changes to the index.html so styling would be easier for larger screen. This included adding more div tags with full-width class and moving around headlines in certain sections. In the email form, I added id attributes to the form elements to make individual styles for the margin and padding. The large screen version isn't completely done. As I do final style updates, I'll go back and play around with Flexbox, margin, and padding for different sections as I go. I was able to get a start on some style updates for mobile.scss file. I took a look at the mobile site to make sure the HTML changes didn't make too many big changes to my site. Tomorrow I'm going to make more adjustments to the form inputs and see if I can improving the spacing between the images and buttons in the popular section.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish style updates for mobile.scss file
- Finish style updates for tablet.scss file

## Day 34: July 4, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish style updates for mobile version of beverage website.

**Day Summary:** The final updates for the mobile version of the beverage site are done. Today I made final changes to the mobile.scss. I changed mostly the padding and margin properties of various selectors. A lot of time was spent updating the email sign up section and seeing if I could improve the spacing of the form elements. While I was updating the styles, I noticed the email placeholder said name instead of email so I went back into the HTML to change the placeholder attribute. I didn't use any Flexbox on the mobile version, but tomorrow I'm going to try using Flexbox and the Flexbox properties to improve the medium screen version of the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish style updates for tablet.scss file
- Start style updates for style.scss file

## Day 35: July 5, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Start adding styles to tablet.scss file. Update styles for base styles, announcements, header, and email sections.

**Day Summary:** Today I got a decent start on the final style updates for tablet.scss file. I set the full-width selector's display to flex and began adding Flexbox properties to various selectors in different sections. The biggest challenge I encountered was the header navigation. I found myself playing around with the margin and padding of the li selector to get the spacing just right while ensuring the li items stayed on the page. The other challenge was the form elements in the email section. I used the ids I created for the individual form elements to get the spacing just right between the inputs. I was able to start adding some updates to the featured section. Tomorrow my goal is to get the feature section done and figuring out what padding would be best for the images so they aren't too close to the top of the page. 

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish style updates for featured section
- Fix padding and margin issues for images in featured section
- Start style updates for popular section

## Day 36: July 6, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish style updates for medium and large screen versions of beverage website. Double check all screen versions in Dev Tools.

**Day Summary:** Today I finished the style updates for tablet.scss and style.scss files. These updates were adjusting the margin and padding of different elements. I did move some of the h2 headlines in the featured and popular sections out of the full-width classes in the HTML. This gave a little bit more spacing between the h2 headlines and the other elements in the sections. Once the styling was done, I didn some final checks of each screen version of the site. I noticed I still have a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the site. Tomorrow I'm going to see if I can figure out what is causing the scroll bar to appear on each screen size version of this site. I think the issue could be in some of the base styles for the site for the width so I'm going to play around with the base styles tomorrow to see if this is the case.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out what is causing the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of all screen size versions of the site

## Day 37: July 7, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Fix style issues creating horizontal scroll bar on beverage website. Adjust margin and width in mobile.scss for buttons.

**Day Summary:** The beverage website is officially finished! I spent the entire session working on all screen versions of the site. I took a few minutes to look at each version of the site. I removed all the scss code to see what the website looked without styles and double check if the HTML was the cause the horizontal scroll bar. Oddly the scroll bar wasn't appearing with just the HTML code so I think the issue is with the styles. After adding the styles back to the scss files, I started to play around with the width for the base styles to see if this would help remove the horizontal scroll bar. It took sometime playing around with the different properties and selectors, but I figured it out. It turns out that the issue was with container class in the tablet.scss and style.scss files having a width of 100%. In the mobile.scss file, I removed the width from the full-width class. I didn't make too many changes to the tablet.scss and style.scss files, but I went back into the mobile.scss to adjust the width of the buttons and margins so they fit on the page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start set up for printing company website

## Day 38: July 8, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Set up and organize code files for printing company website. Began adding HTML code for header.

**Day Summary:** Today I started to work on a brand new project. The next project in the 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge is a printing company website. The entire session was preparing the code files and getting organized so I could start working on the website. After looking at some example sites, I decided to use Bootstrap on this site as well as Sass to make this web page. I didn't do too much coding but I was able to get the header started on the page. This project will be the first one to use dropdown menus so I've been working on getting the dropdown menu created. At the end of the session, I was debating on adding buttons for cart and contacting for help in order to follow the example site I'm trying to recreate. I'm going to think about what I would like to add in the header section and look at more printing company examples to see what else I can include.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish setting up site header
- Start adding section code

## Day 39: July 9, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding HTML code for header and footer of printing company website. Start adding HTML code for individual sections on the page.

**Day Summary:** Today I made more progress on the HTML for the printing company website. I finished working on the header code. I decided to redo the dropdown menu I was originally building and changed the dropdown menu items. I then copied the dropdown menu to create a new dropdown menu for new. After I worked on the header, I decided to get the footer done so I could completely concentrate on getting the sections done on the site. I'm not quite 100% sure what sections I should put on this website so I'm still going to look at other printing company sites to get ideas of what I can use on my website. Today I added two sections to the page. Tomorrow I'm going to concentrate on getting all the HTML sections added to the page as well as updating the ones I added so far. Looking at the banner section I just made, I think I'm going to add a button to the section.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start adding HTML code for sections

## Day 40: July 10, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Update header navigation by creating a new dropdown menu for all products and moving certain list items around. Add new HTML sections for deals, bottom navigation, and trending. Start adding HTML code for email section.

**Day Summary:** Before I started any of today's code, I took a look at different printing company websites and got a good sense of what sections I want to put on my page. At the beginning of the session, I updated the header navigation. I changed the all products list item to a new dropdown menu. Originally the dropdown was appearing on the far left side of the page instead underneath the all products. Once I added the dropdown class to the list item, this fixed the issue instead of what I was doing which was changing the id names for the dropdown elements. The rest of the session was spent adding more HTML sections to the site. At the end of the session, I was adding the last section to the HTML file which is an section for email sign up. Tomorrow my goal is to finish adding this last HTML section so I can start concentrating on the mobile styles.

**What I Did Today:** Add HTML code for email section. Start adding styles for mobile.scss file. Add styles for header. Start adding styles for banner section.

**Day Summary:** I finished all the HTML code today. I just finished the HTML code for the email section. The rest of the session was spent getting the styles started in the mobile.scss file. Before I started adding the styles, I double checked my Google Fonts link and picked colors for my Sass variables. Once I added the variables and base styles, I added the header styles. I went back into the HTML to adjust some of the Bootstrap classes. I found myself using more class names for the styling of different header elements in order to add colors, font sizes, and background colors. Once the header was finished, I started adding styles to the banner section. I'm going to need to style different selectors in a certain way so I started to add class names to different p tags to help with the styling tomorrow. I don't like the background color for the banner section so I'm going to change the color from red to green.

**What I Did Today:** Finish styles for banner section. Add styles for email section. Start adding styles for deal section.

**Day Summary:** I continued to add more styles to the mobile.scss file. Today I was able to finish 2 more sections on the site. I was able to finish the banner section and make changes to the code I already wrote as well adding new properties to the code. Once banner section was finished, I added styles for the email section. The rest of teh session was spent adding styles for the deal section. This is the first time I was playing around with the opacity property. I initially was trying to use it on the background image but this made the text too hard to read. It took time playing around different colors and selectors, but I found it was best using a white background on a div wrapped around the text. I gave this div another class name to use for styling. Tomorrow I need to finish the styling for the deal section then I'm going to move forward with the rest of the styles for the mobile.scss file.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for deal section
- Start adding styles for trending section

**Day Summary:** I'm almost in the home stretch with the mobile.scss file. I finished the styles for deal section I started yesterday. The rest of the session was spent trying to add more styles to different sections. I was able to get almost all the sections styles styled on the site. The only section I need to finish is the footer in mobile.scss file. Tomorrow I'll finish the mobile.scss file then start working on tablet.scss file. Although I was mostly concentrating on the CSS code, I went back into the HTML file to change some of the h4 tags to h3 tags and add more class names to certain tags. Tomorrow I might take time to adjust the spacing between the groups in the bottom nav section.

## Day 44: July 14, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for mobile.scss file. Start adding styles for tablet.scss file. Update Bootstrap classes in index.html file.

**Day Summary:** Today I finished the footer styles in mobile.scss. Originally the font awesome icons weren't appearing on the site. I took a look at the head tag and discovered I set two links for Google Fonts instead of setting a link for the Font Awesome library. Once I added a link to Font Awesome, the icons appeared on the site. Once the footer styles were compiled to the site, I began working on the styles for the tablet.scss file. So far I've managed to get most of the styles done for the tablet.scss file. Tomorrow I just need to add the bottom navigation and footer styles for the medium screen size version of the site. I especially want to play around with the text-block classes to see if I can get the position of the white block of text just right on the site.

- Finish tablet.scss styles
- Start adding styles for style.scss file
- Adjust Bootstrap classes in HTML file for text-block classes

## Day 45: July 15, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish styles for tablet.scss and styles.scss. Made final style changes to all screen size versions.

**Day Summary:** The printing company website is finished. I added the final styles for the tablet.scss and style.scss files. When I was working in the tablet.scss file, I played around with the text-block classes to see how the position would work. I ended up just changing the Bootstrap classes for medium and large screen size to take up 12 columns instead of 6. Other big changes were adding a div tag with the nav-row class around the ul and li items in the header to help with styling the navigation so there would be more spacing. Once all the styles were added to the style.scss file, I went and double checked all the scss files to see if there were any other changes I needed to make to the site before I compiled styles to the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start setup code files for 30 Days, 30 Sites day 15 website
