## Day 1: June 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** I removed all my old project code. I set up code files with new Google Fonts link, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap. I added code for the navigation and began adding code for sections.

**Day Summary:** I decided to completely redo the entire website for this project. This project is going to use Sass so I decided to keep things fairly simple for this site so I can concentrate on Sass. Most of the work was just removing the old code I had from the previous challenge and getting the items I need (i.e. Google Fonts, Font Awesome) ready to go. I didn't dabble with any Sass yet, but I did use the documentation to get my files set up for when I get to Sass later this week. I will search Sass on The Practical Dev to get tips from other developers on using Sass. Today my focus was just getting the HTML code started. The header is done. I just need to decide on what sections to add on the landing page. So I might use my original version as inspiration as well as google some to see what I could add to the home page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding all HTML code to HTML file.
- Look at The Practical Dev for Sass articles.
- Google Photographer websites for inspiration.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Change headlines for banner. Change image for about section. Remove old code for images and created a gallery of six images. Started adding footer.

**Day Summary:** I did a lot of research on photographer websites before working on today's project to get a sense of what items could go on the landing page. After looking at different examples, I updated the code I did yesterday by adding an extra headline in the banner. Although there isn't a background image, I put a link to the background image I want to use in the scss file later. The rest of the time was spent updating img tags with new images. I'm using the Free Code Camp gallery image tutorial to make a gallery on the website. I added all the HTML tags for the gallery. I started to add the footer so I'm ready to start working on the styles tomorrow. However I think tomorrow's session will be playing around with Sass and making sure I can get it working using the Sass documentation as well as articles I find on The Practical Dev.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding code for footer section
- Try to get Sass to work for code files

## Day 3: June 3, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Start playing around with Sass on code files. Began adding styles for mobile version of site. Finish adding HTML to footer.

**Day Summary:** All the HTML is done. I added a few icons for social media graphics. One of the images wasn't working on my gallery so I fixed the issue. The rest of the time was spent working on getting Sass to work. Initially it wasn't working so I removed the app and public folders then moved the folder contents into my root directory. This made everything work and my test styles were appearing on the site. The rest of the time was spent playing around with Sass to try making the mobile styles of my site. The challenge was trying to get the header background color to change. I changed the Bootstrap classes and played around with nested code but I wasn't having much luck. So I decided to keep things simple and scrapped the background color. I did get a head start on the banner section where I began playing around with the headlines. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get find a way to move the headlines down so they are centered in the page and might revisit working on the header styles to see if I can get them to work. Hopefully I'll be able to get to the image gallery tomorrow and get the mobile version of the mobile gallery working.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to fix header styles 
- Finish adding styles for banner
- Find a way to fix background image for banner
- Start adding styles for image gallery

## Day 4: June 4, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Rearrange code for about section. Add headline to Spider Man gallery of images and Bootstrap classes for the images. Fix banner and header sections.

**Day Summary:** I found myself spending more time working in the HTML file than with Sass today. I added lots of Bootstrap classes for the gallery images and the headlines in the banner section. I decided to rearrange the about section by switching the spots for the image and text. The last major addition was a headline tag for the gallery section. The styles are almost done for the mobile version. Before I started to add styles to the other sections I did play around with the header a bit to see if I could my original vision for the site to work. It took some playing with the Bootstrap classes but I managed to get the background color I wanted by removing bg-dark command. Tomorrow I just need to finish the header then I'm going to start working on the styles for the tablet.scss file.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for mobile footer section
- Start adding styles to tablet stylesheet

## Day 5: June 5, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish footer styles for mobile version of site. Start adding styles for medium and large size screens. Played around with Bootstrap classes. Fix issues with Font Awesome icons.

**Day Summary:** The mobile styles are done. At first I was having issues getting the Font Awesome icons to appear on the site. Initially all I had were bullet points with no icons. I had to play around with the HTML code a bit but I found that when I added the Bootstrap nav classes the icons would reappear. I did make the mistake of not starting the compiler in the terminal today so I spent 5 minutes trying to figure out why my styles weren't appearing on my site. So I need to remember from now on to start Sass first thing when I begin working on a project. The rest of the time was adding styles to the tablet.scss. I did get a headstart on styles in style.scss file, but I want to double check all my styles in tablet.scss first before I finish all the styles for large screens. Tomorrow I'd like to get some of the styles added to the image gallery. I'll be interested to see if the styles I want to add will conflict with the Bootstrap classes. 

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles to tablet.scss
- Resume adding styles to style.scss
- Use Free Code Camp image gallery article to make gallery

## Day 6: June 6, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes for gallery. Add new gallery styles for mobile and tablet sylesheets. Start adding more styles to style.scss for large screens.

**Day Summary:** The photographer website is almost done. All the tablet.scss styles have been added and compiled to the site. The rest of the time was spent finishing the styles for style.scss file. It turns out that Bootstrap doesn't work very well with the styles from the Free Code Camp image gallery guide. So I removed the Bootstrap classes in the gallery class. This mean adding new class styles in my other stylesheets to get the similar effects from the Bootstrap classes. I double checked the mobile and tablet versions of the sites and they look the way they need to. But the gallery is still an issue since the images are lined up next to each other instead of being spaced out on the page. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get the gallery styles to work on my site. If not, I'll add back the Bootstrap and find a different layout for the images.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix gallery styles for all site versions
- Finish adding styles to style.scss file

## Day 7: June 7, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for photographer website. Start preparing code files for mobile services and events website. Began adding Bootstrap and HTML code for header.

**Day Summary:** I figured out the issue with my gallery on the photographer website. I set display to flex instead of grid for the gallery class. This was causing the images to line up next to each other. Once I made this change, the images started to be in a grid except for one image. I looked through my code and noticed I was missing a class. Once I added the styles for the gallery, the image size changed to fit on the screen. After double checking my styles, I started preparing code for the next 30 Days, 30 Websites project. I got the files organized and was able to start working on the header. Tomorrow I'm thinking of moving the headline of the site above or underneath the navigation. I will play around with the navigation and see what might look best for the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish HTML for header on mobile services website
- Add Bootstrap code to other sections

## Day 8: June 8, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add new images to meet section. Remove social media section and move code to footer age. Update bottom navigation menu with Bootstrap classes. Started to make e-mail section and build a new form. Move styles from style.css to mobile.scss file.

**Day Summary:** I made a lot of progress working on the HTML. Before I started working on this project, I took a couple of minutes to take a look at CodePen to see what other creators considered a mobile service and event. After seeing those ideas, I decided to stick with my original concept but put in as many Disney references as I could. So I removed some o the images and text tags with newer ones. I deleted a section I had for social media and moved the content to the footer. I am keeping some of the older sections, but these sections are getting more Bootstrap. The header is finished. I decided to move the headline out of the div row. Once I start with the styling, I might move the code around some more later. Right now I'm working on trying to make a form for the e-mail near the bottom of the page. i might move this section up near the top of the page tomorrow, but for now my challenge is getting the form on the site and getting the button done. Tomorrow I will play with more of the Bootstrap classes to see if I can get some spacing between the form elements.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish making form for e-mail section
- Add a section for food truck highlight

## Day 9: June 9, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding HTML to mobile events and service site. Currently trying to figure out how to get Sass to work on the new site.

**Day Summary:** I fixed the issues with the form. I had to use more Bootstrap class for each of the form elements so the elements would be inline and have some spacing in between themselves. After making the form button, I added a section for the highlight section then rearranged the website layout a bit by moving the email section near the top. Now that the HTML is all done, I began working on Sass for the mobile site. Right now the styles are not connecting on the site. I did a test with some code with the main style file but none of the styles were appearing. I'll see if I can quickly troubleshoot the issue tomorrow so I can start adding styles.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Get Sass to work
- Add styles for the base styles for mobile site
- Begin adding Header styles for mobile site

## Day 10: June 10, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Got Sass to work and compile styles. Began adding styles for mobile header of site.

**Day Summary:** Most of my time was spent trying to Sass to work on the site. I used the documentation to double check everything I was doing. I was able to get my test styles working on the large screen version, but none of the styles were being compiled on the other versions of the site. After playing around with the files and changing around the links to the stylesheet, everything started working the way it needed to. I was able to get a start on some of the mobile styles. I changed my mind on the navigation so I did add Bootstrap classes back into the site. I also changed the site title to the site so it would look alongside the button for the navbar on the mobile site. Tomorrow I'll see if I can finish the mobile styles and see how things look on the site before I start adding more styles to the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles to mobile header
- Start adding styles to email section

## Day 11: June 11, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for header on mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites mobile events and services site. Start adding styles for email and meet sections.

**Day Summary:** Today's session was just working on styles. After finishing the header styles, I took a look at the header and decided the colors made it too hard to see anything on a site. So I switched up some of the Sass variables and changed the colors so they were darker. This made a huge difference and was much easier to read. I was able to start adding styles for two sections on the page. The padding was an issue on the page so I started to adjust the Bootstrap classes to see if it would help. I wrapped the contents of the meet seciton in a div with the container class and changed the image classes. Tomorrow I'll see if there any more styles I need to add to the email and meet sections so I can start adding styles for the highlight and footer navigation. I might need to play around with the Bootstrap classes for the footer nav so I'll be playing around with the HTML more tomorrow to get the bottom navigation just right for my site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish add styles for meet section
- Start adding styles for highlight section

## Day 12: June 12, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles to mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites mobile events and services website. Began adding styles to tablet version of header.

**Day Summary:** The mobile version of the site is officially done on my site. When I started the session, I took a couple of minutes to change the font size of the button on my meet section and double check the styles for my meet section. Then I started adding the styles for the highlight section and updating some of the Bootstrap classes in the index.html file. It took a couple of minutes playing around with the Bootstrap classes, but managed to make to the footer navigation work the way I work. This might change as I work on the styles for different screen sizes but for now all the styles are working the way I want. Once the header was finished, I double checked to see how my site looked. I'm not 100% a fan of the h3 and p content in the highlight section, but for now it works the way I want. I was able to start adding code to the tablet.scss file. I was able to get the header styles added to the tablet version of the site. Tomorrow I just need to double check any of the styles I have so far before I can move onto styling for the other sections.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Double check header styles on tablet stylesheet
- Start adding styles to email and meet sections

## Day 13: June 13, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for tablet.scss. Try to fix Bootstrap classes so bottom navigation would work on mobile sites and not clash with styles for medium and large screens.

**Day Summary:** All the tablet.scss styles are added and compiled on the site. I spent a lot of trying to fix the padding for the form button. I tried playing around with the padding for the button since the right side is a little too close to the texxt. I wasn't able to fix the button. I think some of the Bootstrap classes could be preventing the styles from being changed so I'll have to play around with button styles on the tablet version sometime in the future. After spending some time trying to fix the email button, I decided to move onto the rest of the styles. It turns out that the Bootstrap classes were causing problems for the bottom navigation on the tablet version of my site so I had to remove the Bootstrap classes I added yesterday. Instead of adjusting the columns, I just wrapped the tags in divs with the container and row classes. This gave me the navigation look I wanted on the tablet file, but it messed up the styles for my mobile styles. Tomorrow if I have some extra time I'd like to try adding some Flexbox properties to the mobile bottom navigation to see if I can get the effect I had before without using Bootstrap classes.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start add styles for style.scss
- Go back and fix site issues for bottom navigation and email button

## Day 14: June 14, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles to style.scss file and compile styles to site. Update multiple sections in mobile.scss file. Add link tag inside h1 tag in header in index.html.

**Day Summary:** All the styles are now added to the website. I didn't make too many changes to the style.scss file since I wanted to concentrate on getting the mobile.scss style updates started. The rest of the session was spent working on getting the mobile styles updated. Today I managed to get the header, email, meet, and highlight sections done. These sections didn't have too many changes except adding padding to headlines and images so there was a little more spacing between the elements. This made things look better and fixed some of the issues I was having with the highlight section. I wasn't able to get to the bottom navigation, but tomorrow I'll spend my time playing around with Flexbox and see if the properties will help. If they don't, I'll need to rethink my plan.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to fix bottom navigation on mobile site
- Add final style changes to mobile footer

## Day 15: June 15, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes from bottom navigation section. Tried getting bullet points to disappear with text-decoration property. Add headline for bottom navigation.

**Day Summary:** Today I spent all my time working on the styles for the bottom navigation. I played around with Flexbox as best as I could but I decided it was best to remove all the Bootstrap classes. Once all the Bootstrap was removed, I redid the bottom navigation HTML. I might try Flexbox again tomorrow to see if I can get the Flexbox to work on the site. However, the biggest issue I've having now is getting the bullet points to be hidden on the page. The text decoration property isn't working right now. I think this could be the way the tags are nested in the bottom navigation section so I'm going to play around with the tags tomorrow to see if I can find out where the problem is.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to get text-decoration property to work on bottom-nav list
- Do final updates for mobile footer
- Start adding style updates for tablet.scss file

## Day 16: June 16, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish mobile styles for mobile events services website. Add final style updates for tablet.scss file. Start adding styles to style.scss file.

**Day Summary:** After taking at look at my code and playing around with the properties, I was able to get the bottom navigation to work on the mobile site. What I did was make an li selector which uses the list-style-type set to none and padding set to 10px 0. I nested the a and a:hover selector inside. This hid all the bullet points. Once I changed the padding, I added the style updates for the footer before I moving to the tablet.scss file. I ran into more issues with the button in the email section. I removed my initial styles and tried to change the padding on the sides but it would move the padding much farther than I wanted no matter what I did. I decided to just leave the button style the way it is and move on with the rest of the styling. When I got to the bottom navigation in the tablet.scss file, I played around around with Flexbox properties just to see how the elements would look on the page. I eventually just set the display to flex for the ul items and added some padding to left of the li elements to create the bottom navigation in the tablet.scss. I was able to get a headstart on the style.scss styles. The header as a bit of challenge just getting the spacing of the navigation items just right but I added some padding to the left of the li elements to get some spacing in between elements so they weren't too close to the headline. Tomorrow I'm going to finish adding style updates to style.scss then I'll start setting up the code for the next project.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for style.scss file
- Start adding HTML to club website

## Day 17: June 17, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add styles for large screen version of mobile events and services website. Tried adjusting code section to remove horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of page.

**Day Summary:** I wasn't able to start working on the next project. The updates for the style.scss file are taking longer than I was planning. As I was updating styles, I noticed there was a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of page. So I spent the entire session trying to figure out which section was creating the scroll bar. I wasn't able to get the scroll bar to disappear after looking at each of the sections. I double checked how the other versions looked and I didn't see any horizontal scroll bars so tomorrow I'm going to remove all the styles from style.scss file then slowly add styles back to the page to see what might cause the scroll bar to pop up.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to remove horizontal scroll bar on large screen version of site
- Start adding HTML to club website

## Day 18: June 18, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Tried to remove horizontal scroll bar from large screen version of mobile events and services site.

**Day Summary:** I spent the entire session trying to fix the large screen version of my site and remove the horizontal scroll bar. I removed all the styles from the style.scss file to see if I could find the problem. Instead I think I discovered the issue might have come from the index.html file instead. I wasn't able to figure out what the issue is. So tomorrow I'm going to play around with the HTML and see what code is creating the horizontal scroll bar. Once I figure out the issue and fix it, I'll add the styles back to the style.scss file. I'll have to double check the mobile and tablet versions to see if there are any fixes that need to be made before I move onto another project.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Remove HTML code to see what might be causing the horizontal scroll bar 
- Add back in styles for style.scss

## Day 19: June 19, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Add container class to footer. Add styles back to style.scss file. Begin setting up club project code.

**Day Summary:** I figured out what was causing the error on the large screen mobile events and services website. I removed all my HTML code and added each section back in the file one at a time after I checked how everything looked on the browser. It turns out that it was the footer creating the horizontal bar on the page. I fixed the issue by wrapping the contents of the footer in a div tag with the container class. After I fixed the issue, I double checked to see how everything looked on other versions of my site to see if there were any issues I needed to fix. Happily there were no big issues in these versions so I was finally able to turn my attention to my next project. Tomorrow I'm going to begin working on the HTML code for the new site and see if there is any of my old code I'll be keeping for the new version.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Start adding HTML code for header section of club project site
