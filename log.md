## Day 1: July 5, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for navbar on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Started adding styles for header.

**Day Summary:** I was trying to figure out how to style the navbar. The links were still stacked up on each other so I was playing around with the Bootstrap classes. I was trying to use the documentation examples to troubleshoot the issues. Eventually I managed to get the link elements to be inline with each other by rearranging the Bootstrap classes. I did start adding styles for the header. Tomorrow I will concentrate on getting the header to work particularly getting the text in the middle of the background image if possible.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for the header. Try to figure out how to center text in the middle of background image.
- Use https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-3810/ to add more styles for story section.

## Day 2: July 6, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Added Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for header, story and celebration sections on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation page.

**Day Summary:** I finished the header. Although I used some of my original code from the first round of 100 Days of Code, I played around with the styles for the background image. A lot of time was spent on the story section. The columns were stacking on top of each other. It turns out that I forgot the row class which helps get the elements inline with each other. Tomorrow I'll have to remember to use the row class when I work on the location. I added styles for three sections today. I just need to finish the celebration section then I can start tackling the location one tomorrow. I need to start thinking of how to add JavaScript to this project. I might create a modal for RSVP like the W3Schools example but I'm not sure yet.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding colors for celebration section. Play around with line height and padding.
- Start working on the location section. Use the row class to help get any elements inline with each other.
- Move padding for header text.
- Start thinking about a JavaScript component for the project.

## Day 3: July 7, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add more Bootstrap classes and CSS styles to 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Finished styles for location and info sections.

**Day Summary:** I spent a few minutes trying to fix the padding for the header greeting. I managed to get it centered in the middle of the background image, but I tried getting the text over towards the left so it wasn't covering Emma's face. However I ran into issues with the text editor so I just left it the way it is for now. I might play around with it again later. I added a new p tag in the location section. Out of the two sections I did today, location is where I spent most of my time. I was playing around with the columns, image and text to get all the elements the right size and spaced right. I decided I am going to make a modal for the invitation. Tomorrow I'm going to finish adding styles for the rest of the site before I tackle of the JavaScript. I'll do the responsive design once the JavaScript is all done.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles for response section.
- Add Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for footer.
- Start putting together modal. Create a div tag in HTML and start getting JavaScript so it opens when button is clicked.

## Day 4: July 8, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add Bootstrap and CSS styles for response and footer sections. Started to add JavaScript for modal.

**Day Summary:** Response and footer sections are now styled. Most of the time was spent getting started on the modal. I added the modal to my HTML and started adding the styles. I began adding some of the JavaScript to the modal. Right now the modal isn't showing when I click the button so I'm going to have to do some troubleshooting tomorrow. The console is saying the issue is for the close button. Tomorrow I'm going to debug JavaScript and see if I can get it to appear.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix modal JavaScript. Especially the close button. Get the modal to appear on the screen.
- Organize modal HTML.
- Finish CSS for modal.

## Day 5: July 9, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Update HTML, CSS and JavaScript for modal. Tried to get the modal to appear on the screen when button is clicked.

**Day Summary:** I spent 30 minutes working on the modal. I didn't have much success. I did resolve the error with the close button. However the modal is still not appearing on the screen. When I opened Dev Tools, everything is working smoothly. I spent lots of the time looking at JavaScript documentation and reading articles to try different techniques but nothing changed. I think the issue might be in the event listeners and functions. Right now I am trying another tutorial to see if that works. If it doesn't, I'm going to redo the pseudo code and take away the CSS to see if I can get a basic version to appear.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Use documentation from https://hackernoon.com/the-ultimate-guide-for-creating-a-simple-modal-component-in-vanilla-javascript-react-angular-8733e2859b42 to see if modal appears on the screen.

## Day 6: July 10, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Remove JavaScript code I've been using. Rewrote all modal code in HTML. Add links for jQuery and Bootstrap for JavaScript.

**Day Summary:** I spent all my time trying to get the RSVP button to work. The original documentation I was trying to use wasn't working. So I did some googling to see what I could find. In the end, I decided to start over completely. I removed all the CSS and JavaScript code I had written. I began to redo the modal code itself. I read online to add links to the jQuery and Bootstrap JS file so I added those links to see if they would help. Right now I'm going back to using the W3Schools documentation. I'm going to also check out the Bootstrap documentation to see if I can at least get something to appear on the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding modal classes to HTML. Use https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_js_modal.asp to help write code and see if modal code can work.
- Write any JavaScript code to get the RSVP button working.
- Style RSVP button. Currently text is all blue.

## Day 7: July 11, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add jQuery for modal. Began adding styles for the modal.

**Day Summary:** A modal has finally appeared on the site! Initially nothing was appearing after I added the rest of the Bootstrap classes and added the JavaScript in. It turns out the modal didn't have the id set which is why nothing was appearing. As soon as I set the id, a modal appeared on the browser. It was a mess, but it was working. The rest of the time was playing with the CSS. I was having issues styling due the Bootstrap classes I added earlier so I began removing them. This made styling so much easier and less messy.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Add JavaScript so button will toggle on and off.
- Figure out how to get the modal in the middle of the page.
- Remove modal-body and modal-footer classes from the modal.
- Finish adding CSS styles for the modal.
- Think about adding more JS for accept and decline buttons in the modal.

## Day 8: July 12, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Add more div tags to 30 Days, 30 Sites modal. Update CSS styles. Managed to get modal to toggle on with JavaScript. Began adding JS code to get the modal to close.

**Day Summary:** I finished removing the Bootstrap modal code. I organized the modal code into different div tags for the modal header, body and footer. I started to add more CSS to the modal code. I originally had padding and height set for some of the modal elements but I removed them in order to play around with the .modal padding to see why it was moving the modal into the center of the page. I revisited the W3Schools modal tutorial and began having better luck with adding most of the CSS. I started adding the JavaScript. So far the variables are done. I am getting an error saying the onclick property isn't working so tomorrow I'm going to be doing some debugging to see onclick isn't working despite the button allowing the modal to open when it is clicked.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- fix the onclick property issue from error message.
- Adjust padding and height for modal elements.

## Day 9: July 13, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Fix issues for modal in 30 Days, 30 sites event invitation. Got modal to close. Move modal code closer to the RSVP button.

**Day Summary:** I'm almost in the home stretch with the modal. I figured out why I was getting errors in the console. It turns out that I added the punctuation for the IDs and classes was causing the onclick errors. As soon as I removed the punctuation in the variables, everything started to pass and it began start acting as a modal. The only issue I have now when the modal closes, the backdrop still remains dark. I will try playing around with some of the JS code to see if I can get the backdrop to get back to normal. I started playing with the JS a little bit, but I wasn't having much luck. I think I might have to try setting the data attributes but I'm not 100% sure if that is the right solution.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Think about removing modal close button or find a solution so when the modal is closed, the opacity returns back to normal and doesn't stay in a black background.
- Add CSS for the modal content.

## Day 10: July 14, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Fixed modal backdrop. Tried making responsive styles for 30 Days, 30 sites event invitation. Started set up for next project.

**Day Summary:** I fixed the modal backdrop. After reading some of the documentation and some articles, I decided to just remove the data attributes on the modal button. Once I removed the data attributes I added some background color to the modal. This make a huge difference and would be removed when the modal closed. I tried working on the responsive styles for the site but Dev Tools was acting up. When I was refreshing my site preview, Dev Tools immediately paused the site in the debugger. I tried googling for a solution but I wasn't having much luck. I finally got frustrated and decided to switch gears by starting set up on the next project. Tomorrow I'm going to try again to see if I can get the responsive styles to work in the previewer but if I can't I'll just move onto the next project.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Try figuring out the mobile styles for event invitation.
- Finish set up on tourist attraction website.
- Start working on HTML for new project.

## Day 11: July 15, 2019
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes for navbar in 30 Days, 30 Sites invitation. Start adding mobile CSS styles.

**Day Summary:** I did some googling before starting this coding session to see what was going on with Dev Tools. I did manage to get it fixed, but I was just clicking around with elements in the source window. Whatever I did do I fixed everything. During the session, the navbar wasn't fitting on the entire page when it was on a mobile screen. I ended up removing the navbar Bootstrap classes which fixed the problem. I'll just need to use CSS to replicate what I originally had. I started adding the mobile styles to the site. I was originally was going put all the styles in the same style sheet, but I decided to add a CSS folder and create separate files for different stylesheets for each. Right now I'm working on the mobile styles. Biggest issue I have is the input is cutting off near the left side of the screen when the modal is open. Tomorrow I'll see if I can change the CSS so that doesn't happen on the mobile version of the modal.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix input bar in mobile CSS style sheet.
- Add CSS styles for mobile footer section.
- Start adding styles for responsive styles.
