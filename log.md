## Day 1: June 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** I removed all my old project code. I set up code files with new Google Fonts link, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap. I added code for the navigation and began adding code for sections.

**Day Summary:** I decided to completely redo the entire website for this project. This project is going to use Sass soo I decided to keep things fairly simple for this site so I can concentrate on Sass. Most of the work was just removing the old code I had from the previous challenge and getting the items I need (i.e. Google Fonts, Font Awesome) ready to go. I didn't dabble with any Sass yet, but I did use the documentation to get my files set up for when I get to Sass later this week. I will search Sass on The Practical Dev to get tips from other developers on using Sass. Today my focus was just getting the HTML code started. The header is done. I just need to decide on what sections to add on the landing page. So I might use my original version as inspiration as well as google some to see what I could add to the home page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding all HTML code to HTML file.
- Look at The Practical Dev for Sass articles.
- Google Photographer websites for inspiration.
