## Day 1: June 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** I removed all my old project code. I set up code files with new Google Fonts link, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap. I added code for the navigation and began adding code for sections.

**Day Summary:** I decided to completely redo the entire website for this project. This project is going to use Sass so I decided to keep things fairly simple for this site so I can concentrate on Sass. Most of the work was just removing the old code I had from the previous challenge and getting the items I need (i.e. Google Fonts, Font Awesome) ready to go. I didn't dabble with any Sass yet, but I did use the documentation to get my files set up for when I get to Sass later this week. I will search Sass on The Practical Dev to get tips from other developers on using Sass. Today my focus was just getting the HTML code started. The header is done. I just need to decide on what sections to add on the landing page. So I might use my original version as inspiration as well as google some to see what I could add to the home page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding all HTML code to HTML file.
- Look at The Practical Dev for Sass articles.
- Google Photographer websites for inspiration.

## Day 1: June 2, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Change headlines for banner. Change image for about section. Remove old code for images and created a gallery of six images. Started adding footer.

**Day Summary:** I did a lot of research on photographer websites before working on today's project to get a sense of what items could go on the landing page. After looking at different examples, I updated the code I did yesterday by adding an extra headline in the banner. Although there isn't a background image, I put a link to the background image I want to use in the scss file later. The rest of the time was spent updating img tags with new images. I'm using the Free Code Camp gallery image tutorial to make a gallery on the website. I added all the HTML tags for the gallery. I started to add the footer so I'm ready to start working on the styles tomorrow. However I think tomorrow's session will be playing around with Sass and making sure I can get it working using the Sass documentation as well as articles I find on The Practical Dev.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding code for footer section
- Try to get Sass to work for code files
