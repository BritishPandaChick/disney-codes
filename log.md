## Day 1: June 1, 2020
**What I Did Today:** I removed all my old project code. I set up code files with new Google Fonts link, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap. I added code for the navigation and began adding code for sections.

**Day Summary:** I decided to completely redo the entire website for this project. This project is going to use Sass so I decided to keep things fairly simple for this site so I can concentrate on Sass. Most of the work was just removing the old code I had from the previous challenge and getting the items I need (i.e. Google Fonts, Font Awesome) ready to go. I didn't dabble with any Sass yet, but I did use the documentation to get my files set up for when I get to Sass later this week. I will search Sass on The Practical Dev to get tips from other developers on using Sass. Today my focus was just getting the HTML code started. The header is done. I just need to decide on what sections to add on the landing page. So I might use my original version as inspiration as well as google some to see what I could add to the home page.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding all HTML code to HTML file.
- Look at The Practical Dev for Sass articles.
- Google Photographer websites for inspiration.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Change headlines for banner. Change image for about section. Remove old code for images and created a gallery of six images. Started adding footer.

**Day Summary:** I did a lot of research on photographer websites before working on today's project to get a sense of what items could go on the landing page. After looking at different examples, I updated the code I did yesterday by adding an extra headline in the banner. Although there isn't a background image, I put a link to the background image I want to use in the scss file later. The rest of the time was spent updating img tags with new images. I'm using the Free Code Camp gallery image tutorial to make a gallery on the website. I added all the HTML tags for the gallery. I started to add the footer so I'm ready to start working on the styles tomorrow. However I think tomorrow's session will be playing around with Sass and making sure I can get it working using the Sass documentation as well as articles I find on The Practical Dev.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding code for footer section
- Try to get Sass to work for code files

## Day 3: June 3, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Start playing around with Sass on code files. Began adding styles for mobile version of site. Finish adding HTML to footer.

**Day Summary:** All the HTML is done. I added a few icons for social media graphics. One of the images wasn't working on my gallery so I fixed the issue. The rest of the time was spent working on getting Sass to work. Initially it wasn't working so I removed the app and public folders then moved the folder contents into my root directory. This made everything work and my test styles were appearing on the site. The rest of the time was spent playing around with Sass to try making the mobile styles of my site. The challenge was trying to get the header background color to change. I changed the Bootstrap classes and played around with nested code but I wasn't having much luck. So I decided to keep things simple and scrapped the background color. I did get a head start on the banner section where I began playing around with the headlines. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get find a way to move the headlines down so they are centered in the page and might revisit working on the header styles to see if I can get them to work. Hopefully I'll be able to get to the image gallery tomorrow and get the mobile version of the mobile gallery working.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Figure out how to fix header styles 
- Finish adding styles for banner
- Find a way to fix background image for banner
- Start adding styles for image gallery

## Day 4: June 4, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Rearrange code for about section. Add headline to Spider Man gallery of images and Bootstrap classes for the images. Fix banner and header sections.

**Day Summary:** I found myself spending more time working in the HTML file than with Sass today. I added lots of Bootstrap classes for the gallery images and the headlines in the banner section. I decided to rearrange the about section by switching the spots for the image and text. The last major addition was a headline tag for the gallery section. The styles are almost done for the mobile version. Before I started to add styles to the other sections I did play around with the header a bit to see if I could my original vision for the site to work. It took some playing with the Bootstrap classes but I managed to get the background color I wanted by removing bg-dark command. Tomorrow I just need to finish the header then I'm going to start working on the styles for the tablet.scss file.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish styles for mobile footer section
- Start adding styles to tablet stylesheet

## Day 5: June 5, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish footer styles for mobile version of site. Start adding styles for medium and large size screens. Played around with Bootstrap classes. Fix issues with Font Awesome icons.

**Day Summary:** The mobile styles are done. At first I was having issues getting the Font Awesome icons to appear on the site. Initially all I had were bullet points with no icons. I had to play around with the HTML code a bit but I found that when I added the Bootstrap nav classes the icons would reappear. I did make the mistake of not starting the compiler in the terminal today so I spent 5 minutes trying to figure out why my styles weren't appearing on my site. So I need to remember from now on to start Sass first thing when I begin working on a project. The rest of the time was adding styles to the tablet.scss. I did get a headstart on styles in style.scss file, but I want to double check all my styles in tablet.scss first before I finish all the styles for large screens. Tomorrow I'd like to get some of the styles added to the image gallery. I'll be interested to see if the styles I want to add will conflict with the Bootstrap classes. 

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish adding styles to tablet.scss
- Resume adding styles to style.scss
- Use Free Code Camp image gallery article to make gallery

## Day 6: June 6, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Remove Bootstrap classes for gallery. Add new gallery styles for mobile and tablet sylesheets. Start adding more styles to style.scss for large screens.

**Day Summary:** The photographer website is almost done. All the tablet.scss styles have been added and compiled to the site. The rest of the time was spent finishing the styles for style.scss file. It turns out that Bootstrap doesn't work very well with the styles from the Free Code Camp image gallery guide. So I removed the Bootstrap classes in the gallery class. This mean adding new class styles in my other stylesheets to get the similar effects from the Bootstrap classes. I double checked the mobile and tablet versions of the sites and they look the way they need to. But the gallery is still an issue since the images are lined up next to each other instead of being spaced out on the page. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get the gallery styles to work on my site. If not, I'll add back the Bootstrap and find a different layout for the images.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Fix gallery styles for all site versions
- Finish adding styles to style.scss file

## Day 7: June 7, 2020
**What I Did Today:** Finish adding styles for photographer website. Start preparing code files for mobile services and events website. Began adding Bootstrap and HTML code for header.

**Day Summary:** I figured out the issue with my gallery on the photographer website. I set display to flex instead of grid for the gallery class. This was causing the images to line up next to each other. Once I made this change, the images started to be in a grid except for one image. I looked through my code and noticed I was missing a class. Once I added the styles for the gallery, the image size changed to fit on the screen. After double checking my styles, I started preparing code for the next 30 Days, 30 Websites project. I got the files organized and was able to start working on the header. Tomorrow I'm thinking of moving the headline of the site above or underneath the navigation. I will play around with the navigation and see what might look best for the site.

**Tomorrow's List:**
- Finish HTML for header on mobile services website
- Add Bootstrap code to other sections
